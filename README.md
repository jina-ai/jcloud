‚òÅÔ∏è **To the cloud!** - Smoothly deploy a local project as a cloud service. Radically easy, no brainfuck.

üéØ **Cut to the chase** - One CLI with five commands to manage the lifecycle of your Jina projects.

üéüÔ∏è **Early free access** - Sneak peek at our stealthy cloud hosting platform. Built on latest cloud-native tech stack, we now host your Jina project and offer computational and storage resources, for free!

## Install

```bash
pip install jcloud
jc -h
```

In case `jc` is already occupied by another tool, please use `jcloud` instead. If your pip install doesn't register bash command for you, you can do `python -m jcloud -h`.

## Get Started

### Login

```bash
jc login
```

You can use Google/Github account to register and login. Without login, you can do nothing.

### Deploy a Jina Project

In Jina's idiom, a project is a [Flow](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/flow/), which represents an end-to-end task such as indexing, searching, recommending. In the sequel, we will use "project" and "Flow" interchangeably.

A Flow can have two types of file structure:

- **A folder**: just like a regular Python project, you can have sub-folders of Executor implementations; and a `flow.yml` on the top-level to connect all Executors together. You can create an example project folder via `jc new`. This is often used in **prototyping**.
- **A single YAML file**: a self-contained YAML file, consisting of all configs at the Flow-level and [Executor](https://docs.jina.ai/fundamentals/executor/)-level. Note that, all Executors' `uses: ` must follow `uses: jinahub+docker://MyExecutor` (from [Jina Hub](https://hub.jina.ai)) or `uses: docker://your_dockerhub_org/MyExecutor` (from Docker Hub) to avoid any local file dependency. This is often used in **production**.

#### Deploy a Flow from a folder

```bash
jc new ./hello
jc deploy ./hello
```

#### Deploy a Flow from a single YAML

```bash
jc deploy toy.yml
```

The simplest `toy.yml` looks like the following:

```yaml
jtype: Flow
executors: {}
```

Flow is successfully deployed when you see:

<p align="center">
<a href="https://jcloud.jina.ai"><img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/jcloud/blob/main/.github/README-img/deploy.png?raw=true" width="50%"></a>
</p>

You will get a Flow ID, say `84b8b495df`. This ID is required to manage, view logs and remove the Flow.

As this Flow is deployed with default gRPC gateway (feel free changing it to http or websocket), you can use `jina.Client` to access it:

```python
from jina import Client, Document

c = Client(host='grpcs://84b8b495df.wolf.jina.ai')
print(c.post('/', Document(text='hello')))
```

#### Resource request

By default, `jcloud` allocates `100M` of RAM to each Executor. There might be cases where your Executor requires more memory. For example, DALLE-mini (generating image from text prompt) would need more than 100M to load the model. Here's how you can request for more memory while deploying the Flow.

```yaml
jtype: Flow
with:
  protocol: http
executors:
  - name: dalle_mini
    uses: jinahub+docker://DalleMini
    resources:
      memory: 8G
```

### View logs

To watch the logs in realtime.

```bash
jc logs 84b8b495df
```

### Remove a Flow

```bash
jc remove 84b8b495df
```

### Get the status of a Flow

```bash
jc status 84b8b495df
```

<p align="center">
<a href="https://jcloud.jina.ai"><img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/jcloud/blob/main/.github/README-img/status.png?raw=true" width="50%"></a>
</p>

### List all Flows on the cloud

```bash
jc list
```

You can only see the Flows deployed by you.

<p align="center">
<a href="https://jcloud.jina.ai"><img src="https://github.com/jina-ai/jcloud/blob/main/.github/README-img/list.png?raw=true" width="50%"></a>
</p>

You can also filter your Flows by passing a status.

```
jc list --status DELETED
```

### Verbose logs

To make the output more verbose, you can add `--loglevel DEBUG` _before_ each CLI subcommand, e.g.

```bash
jc --loglevel DEBUG deploy toy.yml
```

gives you more comprehensive output.

## FAQ

- **Why does it take a while on every operation of `jcloud`?**

  Because the event listener at Jina Cloud is serveless by design, which means it spawns an instance on-demand to process your requests from `jcloud`. Note that operation such as `deploy`, `remove` in `jcloud` is not high-frequent. Hence, having a serveless listener is much more cost-efficient than an always-on listener. The downside is slower operations, nevertheless this does not affect the deployed service. Your deployed service is **always on**.

- **How long do you persist my service?**

  Until you manually `remove` it, we will persist your service as long as possible.

- **Is everything free?**

  Yes! We just need your feedback - use `jc survey` to help us understand your needs.

- **How powerful is Jina Cloud?**

  Jina Cloud scales according to your need. You can demand for the resources your Flow requires. If there's anything particular you'd be looking for, you can contact us [on Slack](https://slack.jina.ai) or let us know via `jc survey`.

- **How do I send request to a HTTP server?**

  First, you need to set the Flow protocol to `http`. Then make sure you are sending to `/post` endpoint, e.g.

  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://6893976a58.wolf.jina.ai/post -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"data":[{"text": "hello, world!"}], "execEndpoint":"/"}'
  ```
