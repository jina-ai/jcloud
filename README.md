‚òÅÔ∏è **To the cloud!** - Smoothly deploy a local project as a cloud service. Radically easy, no nasty surprises.

üéØ **Cut to the chase** - One CLI with five commands to manage the lifecycle of your Jina projects.

üéüÔ∏è **Early free access** - Sneak peek at our stealthy cloud hosting platform. Built on latest cloud-native tech stack, we now host your Jina project and offer computational and storage resources, for free!

## Install

```bash
pip install jcloud
jc -h
```

In case `jc` is already occupied by another tool, please use `jcloud` instead. If your pip install doesn't register bash commands for you, you can run `python -m jcloud -h`.
